Instructions

Suppose that you have data in two different places and you need to work with both at the same time. Python gives you the ability to extend dictionaries with data from each other. This challenge will help you learn how to combine dictionaries, or extend one dictionary with the contents of another.

Write a function called dictionary_masher that will take two dictionaries and return a single dictionary with non-duplicated keys.

The following shows an example output:

{'name': 'Amos', 'age': 100}
